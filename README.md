# OCR

This project is created using easy ocr librqary with python base.

The main advantage of this project is the gui interface, that opens a windows explorer window.

From this window, we can select the image file for which the character to be recognised is run.

This process reduces the time by giving the command of file location of every new file to be character recognised, by over lapping it with a windows explorer window to select teh file to get the OCR.
